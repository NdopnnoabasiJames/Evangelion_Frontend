### **What We're Doing Next (Phase 3):**

**Goal: Essential CRUD operations for the core event management features**

### **Phase 3 Implementation Plan:**

#### **1. Events Page** ðŸŽª

* **List events** (filtered by user role/hierarchy)
* **Create/edit events** (role-based permissions)
* **Event selection** (branch/zone selection)
* Event status management and hierarchical creation

#### **2. Guests Page** ðŸ‘¥

* **Guest registration** by workers
* **Guest search and management**
* **Basic analytics** (guest counts, status tracking)
* Guest profile management

#### **3. Check-in System** âœ…

* **Simple registrar interface** for guest check-in
* **Guest search** by name/phone
* **Check-in statistics** and real-time updates
* QR code scanning capabilities

### **Key Features We'll Build:**

1. **Events Management:**
   * Event creation forms with role-based field access
   * Event listing with filters and search
   * Event editing and status updates
   * Hierarchical event creation (Super Admin â†’ State â†’ Branch)
2. **Guest Management:**
   * Guest registration forms for workers
   * Guest database with search and filters
   * Guest profile pages with event history
   * Bulk guest operations
3. **Check-in System:**
   * Quick check-in interface for registrars
   * Guest lookup and verification
   * Real-time check-in statistics
   * Mobile-friendly design for on-site use

### **Technical Implementation:**

* Connect to existing NestJS backend APIs
* Implement role-based permissions for each feature
* Add proper error handling and loading states
* Ensure mobile responsiveness for field use
* Maintain EVANGELION design system

**Ready to start Phase 3?** We'll begin with the **Events Page** as it's the foundation for the guest management and check-in systems. This will give users the ability to create and manage the events that guests will register for and check into.
